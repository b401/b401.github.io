## Hello friends!
Some time ago I've got a NFC Chip ([X3 Elite](https://chip-implants.com/shop/nfc-implant-x3-elite/)) implanted on my right hand.  
As I've never documented the steps what to do when I've finally taken the jump to be one step closer to the machinegod, I thougth it would be appropriate do do it here.



### Entrypoint & Pain

The implant itself is 3x13mm.

As you can see in the following image there's almost no visible scar.

The scar after the injection healed after around 3 days.

The pain was also not that bad (like a normal vaccine injection) even though the needle was pretty big.
On a daily basis I don't feel the implant at all. It only gets a little uncomfortable when doing grip strenght training.

Sadly I don't have any pictures of the procedure itself.

### Chip

#### UID 
Each chip comes with an unique UID which normaly can't be changed.  
At least until someone found an exploit [hacking mifare classic](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/sp-14/materials/arsenal/sp-14-Almeida-Hacking-MIFARE-Classic-Cards-Slides.pdf)

Not all cards contain those chinese UID implementations. So it's crucial that the implant uses such a chip.

#### Protocols
The X3 Elite supports mifare classic which is enough for my purposes.

#### ACR122U
I've ordered an ACR122u from aliexpress [Buy now!](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000437557071.html).  
But please check your local store first as there's not a big price difference.

### Software
Software comes already with the kit from chip-implants.com. ( Windows software that is... )   
On GNU/Linux there is an excellent nfc library which you can download for free [nfc-tools](https://github.com/nfc-tools/).  
There are also multiple apps for android available.

#### Install drivers'n stuff

Libnfc is the driver which handles the USB<=>NFC connection.  
MFOC contains multiple tools that we'll need to use later.

```
# pacman -S libnfc mfoc
```
#### Get them keys & dump it!
Every sector is normally encrypted with a specific key.  
Mifare classic implementations use the so called A and B key for those sections.

This part could come in handy.  


I can straight up dump the cards which already contains the keys A&B.  
If you're just interested in the keys you can use [this](https://github.com/nfc-tools/miLazyCracker) tool.

```
mfoc -O hand_dump.dmp
# swap out your hand with the card to dump
mfoc -O card_dump.dmp
```

mfoc bruteforces each block and dumps to content to the output file.  
It looks something like this:

```
@tatsumaki x$ mfoc -O card_dump.dmp
Found Mifare Classic 1k tag
ISO/IEC 14443A (106 kbps) target:
    ATQA (SENS_RES): 00  04  
* UID size: single
* bit frame anticollision supported
       UID (NFCID1): 1a  a4  91  0e  
      SAK (SEL_RES): 08  
* Not compliant with ISO/IEC 14443-4
* Not compliant with ISO/IEC 18092

Fingerprinting based on MIFARE type Identification Procedure:
* MIFARE Classic 1K
* MIFARE Plus (4 Byte UID or 4 Byte RID) 2K, Security level 1
* SmartMX with MIFARE 1K emulation
Other possible matches based on ATQA & SAK values:

Try to authenticate to all sectors with default keys...
Symbols: '.' no key found, '/' A key found, '\' B key found, 'x' both keys found
[Key: ffffffffffff] -> [xxxx.xxxxxxxxxxx]
[Key: a0a1a2a3a4a5] -> [xxxx.xxxxxxxxxxx]
[Key: d3f7d3f7d3f7] -> [xxxx.xxxxxxxxxxx]
[Key: 000000000000] -> [xxxx.xxxxxxxxxxx]
[Key: b0b1b2b3b4b5] -> [xxxx.xxxxxxxxxxx]
....
```

#### Clone the card onto your hand
As the implant is already unlocked (allows overwriting of block 0) I can run the following command to write the contents right into my hand.

```
@tatsumaki mydumps$ nfc-mfclassic W b card_dump.dmp hand_dump.dmp 
NFC reader: ACS / ACR122U PICC Interface opened
Found MIFARE Classic card:
ISO/IEC 14443A (106 kbps) target:
    ATQA (SENS_RES): 00  04  
       UID (NFCID1): 3b  a9  15  1f  
      SAK (SEL_RES): 08  
RATS support: no
Guessing size: seems to be a 1024-byte card
Sent bits:     50  00  57  cd  
Sent bits:     40 (7 bits)
Received bits: a (4 bits)
Sent bits:     43  
Received bits: 0a  
Card unlocked
Writing 64 blocks |................................................................|
Done, 64 of 64 blocks written.
```

nfc-mfclassic uses hereby the keys from _hand_dump.dmp_ to write the new sections onto it.

#### Comparing my hand with my dump
Just like before I dump my hand again into a file.  
As I know the right keys to A and B, I can speed up this process
```
mfoc -O hand_card.dump -k {KeyA} -k {KeyB}
```

I used cmp to quickly compare them
```
tatsumaki $ cmp hand_card.dmp card_dump.dmp
tatsumaki $ echo $?
0
```

### Conclusion
The injection wasn't that bad and it's a great topic to talk about.  
NFC can travel around 2cm through the tissue so it isn't that bad.  
It gets a little uncomfortable during strength training but it's not worth talking about.


If you're paranoid you should get yourself an implant before they'll force you to get one of theirs.
